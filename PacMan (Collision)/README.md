# Pacman (Collision) Game

In this project we created the game Pacman, at least, part of it.

The main idea was to be able to create the game with Pacman, the ghosts and the collision of the walls.

In this project we wanted to calculate for every Ghost and Pacman the collisions with the walls, we wanted to create the walls in a easy way and nothing else.

With the aim to finish the game but improve the performance, the full game will be accomplished using another strategy (Road Map) and this project will keep frozen.

For the collisions we have created an array and we compare the position of the "Mobs" and the walls in order to check the collisions.

For the creation of the map, one binary matrix has been created in order to be easy for the developer to create the levels.
