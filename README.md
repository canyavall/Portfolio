# Portfolio

In this repository, I want to show some of the projects I've been working on in the last months.

Actually, some of the projects are finished and other ones were frozen. The idea was to keep working on the projects, and, if I could find a better way to finish the project, just close the project and start it again.

In every project can be found a brief explanation. How it works and if some decision was taken in order to change the behaviour, improve the performance or implement a new knowledge.

The projects that can be found are:

* Javascript
  * [Pong](https://github.com/canyavall/Portfolio/tree/master/pong)
  * [Pacman - Collision version (Frozen)](https://github.com/canyavall/Portfolio/tree/master/PacMan%20(Collision))
  * [Pacman - Road Map version (Building)](https://github.com/canyavall/Portfolio/tree/master/PacMan%20(RoadMap))
  * [Snake](https://github.com/canyavall/Portfolio/tree/master/Snake)

* Java
  * [Bank](https://github.com/canyavall/Portfolio/tree/master/Bank)

* [Think code](https://github.com/canyavall/Portfolio/tree/master/ThinkCode)
