# Pong game

It was one of the first games developed full in JavaScript.

The main idea was learning about the basics of JavaScript and, at the same time, practice with collisions and canvas in JavaScript

The project was completed in one day and actually is working. not a lot of time was invested on the look and feel.

The tools and methods used for this project are:
* Language
  * JavaScript ES6
  * CSS3
  * HTML5
* Tools
  * Webpack
  * Node
  * Babel  

The game can be played by two users.

Left player requires the keys
* "S": Paddle goes up
* "W": Paddle goes down
* "Q": The collision is reverted

Right player requires the keys
* "L": Paddle goes up
* "P": Paddle goes down
* "^": The collision is reverted
