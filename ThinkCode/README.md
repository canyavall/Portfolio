# Think Code

In internet and in some places (Topcoder, Codewars) I've found some good challenging exercises to force the brain to think.

In this folder we can see some of them, some are written in java and others on JavaScript.

The code written in each of this exercises are homemade, none was copied or any code was checked on internet.

* JavaScript
  * Diagonal_sum: Given a matrix we want to know the difference between the sum of 2 diagonals numbers. Ex: Given the array [7,-12,6,-3,8,1,23,-16,4] the result would be 18
  * Diamond: Given a number, we have to return a string that displays a diamond shape on the screen using asterisk characters
  * maxSumArray: Finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array or list of integers
  * repatedWords: Function that given a string returns an array containing the most frequent word in it.
  * romanNumbers: Function that takes a roman numeral as input, and returns the same number in Hindu-Arabic form and the other way.
  * decodeColor: Function that given one string normalizes to a color and the other way.
  * duplicateEncoder: Return char depending on if a char from an string is repeated or not.
  * humanReadable: Parse seconds to hours:minutes:seconds
  * simplePigLatin: Change one string by rules
  * sortTheOdd: Given an array of numbers, sort the odd but not the even
  * doneOrNot: Checks if a sudoke is already finished or not
  * dirReduc: Reduce an array of directions depending on the direction
  * rangeExtraction: Given an array of ordered ints, check if there are a range in and set it
  * secretString: Find a secret string inside an array of arrays
  * shortestTime: Shortest time a person needs to go from a floor n to the first floor
  * openOrSenior: Check if a user is open or senior
  * sumStrings: Given the string representations of two integers, return the string representation of the sum of those integers.
  * supermarketQueue: There is a queue for the self-checkout tills at the supermarket. Calculate the total time required for all the customers to check out!
  * tripleDouble: Takes in numbers num1 and num2 and returns 1 if there is a straight triple of a number at any place in num1 and also a straight double of the same number in num2
  * longestCommon: earch the longest consequtive subsequence
  * Automaton: read from an array and check the positions and final value
  * mix: Given 2 string, find the subsequence of each and return where are they found
  * flatAndSort: Given 1 bidimensional Array, return a sorted array of them
  * filterLucky: filter if a number in an array of numbers has the number 7 inside
  * maxPOssibleScore: Check max score from an object and an array
  * snailSort: Given an n x n array, return the array elements arranged from outermost elements to the middle element, traveling clockwise.
  * alternateLetter: Create a function that accepts a string as an argument and validates whether the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and consonants are in alternate order.

* Java
  * findLetter: Finds a missing char in one string

* PHP
  * ReverseRotate:The input is a string str of digits. Cut the string into chunks of size "x". If a chunk represents an integer such as the sum of the cubes of its digits is divisible by 2, reverse that chunk; otherwise rotate it to the left by one position. Put together these modified chunks and return the result as a string.
