# Think Code

In internet and in some places (Topcoder) I've found some good challenging exercises to force the brain to think.

In this folder we can see some of them, some are written in java and others on JavaScript.

The code written in each of this exercises are homemade, none was copied or any code was checked on internet.

* JavaScript
  * Diagonal_sum: Given a matrix we want to know the difference between the sum of 2 diagonals numbers. Ex: Given the array [7,-12,6,-3,8,1,23,-16,4] the result would be 18
  * Diamond: Given a number, we have to return a string that displays a diamond shape on the screen using asterisk characters

* Java
