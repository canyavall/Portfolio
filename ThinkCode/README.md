# Think Code

In internet and in some places (Topcoder, Codewars) I've found some good challenging exercises to force the brain to think.

In this folder we can see some of them, some are written in java and others on JavaScript.

The code written in each of this exercises are homemade, none was copied or any code was checked on internet.

* JavaScript
  * Diagonal_sum: Given a matrix we want to know the difference between the sum of 2 diagonals numbers. Ex: Given the array [7,-12,6,-3,8,1,23,-16,4] the result would be 18
  * Diamond: Given a number, we have to return a string that displays a diamond shape on the screen using asterisk characters
  * maxSumArray: Finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array or list of integers
  * repatedWords: Function that given a string returns an array containing the most frequent word in it.
  * romanNumbers: Function that takes a roman numeral as input, and returns the same number in Hindu-Arabic form and the other way.
  * decodeColor: Function that given one string normalizes to a color and the other way.
  * duplicateEncode: Return char depending on if a char from an string is repeated or not.

* Java
  * findLetter: Finds a missing char in one string

* PHP
  * ReverseRotate:The input is a string str of digits. Cut the string into chunks of size "x". If a chunk represents an integer such as the sum of the cubes of its digits is divisible by 2, reverse that chunk; otherwise rotate it to the left by one position. Put together these modified chunks and return the result as a string.
